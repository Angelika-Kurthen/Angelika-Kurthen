- 👋 Hi, I’m @Angelika-Kurthen
- 👀 I’m interested in the population and community dynamics and responses of aquatic invertebrates to novel environmental conditions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to parameterize and validate matrix models to represent different aquatic invertebrates and their species-specific responses to seasonality and disturbance. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on math modeling and aquatic invertebrate research.
- 📫 How to reach me: kurthena@oregonstate.edu
